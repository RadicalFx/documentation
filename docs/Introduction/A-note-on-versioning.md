The developers follow the following versioning scheme:

major.minor.patch-extensions.version

We use the following [semantic versioning policy](http://semver.org/):

    major           - version when you make incompatible API changes.
    minor           - when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
    patch           - when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
    extensions      - pre-release extensions
    version         - pre-release version
