The Radical source code includes several samples that are divided per scope and technology, the “Samples” solution folder structure is the following:

* net40: samples for desktop solutions based on the full .net framework 4.0 (quite all the features are supported even in 3.5 and 4.5);
	* Radical.Samples: a set of samples for each single Radical feature;
	* Radical.Presentation.Samples: an end to end sample for the MVVM and UI Composition toolkit;
* netcore45: a sample MVVM application for WinRT;
* sl50: samples for Silverlight solutions based on the Silverlight 4.0;
	* Radical.Samples: a set of samples for each single Radical feature (under development);
	* Radical.Presentation.Samples: an end to end sample for the MVVM and UI Composition toolkit;

All the samples are constantly under heavy development and are used to test all the Radical features.
