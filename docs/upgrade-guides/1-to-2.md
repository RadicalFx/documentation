### How to migrate a Radical .NET Framework project to a Radical for .NET Core 3 one

1. Create a new .NET Core WPF project with the same name of the project you want to migrate
2. Replace the .NET Framework csproj file with the file of the project created on step 1 (the core project will scan and add all the files of the project, so no manual changes are needed)
3. Delete "Properties" folder 
4. Copy "AssemblyInfo.cs" from the project created on step 1 to the root project folder
5. Take note of the NuGet references from the "packages.config" file and then delete it. 
6. Add the needed references from NuGet
