## Upgrade from Radical Presentation 1.x to Radical 2.0.0 for .NET Core

### New XML namespaces

New XML namespaces have been defined, the following is the list of the new namespaces:

- `http://schemas.radicalframework.com/windows/behaviors`
- `http://schemas.radicalframework.com/windows/input`
- `http://schemas.radicalframework.com/windows`
- `http://schemas.radicalframework.com/windows/converters`
- `http://schemas.radicalframework.com/windows/controls`
- `http://schemas.radicalframework.com/windows/effects`
- `http://schemas.radicalframework.com/windows/markup`
- `http://schemas.radicalframework.com/windows/regions` 

The existing XML namespaces, starting with `http://schemas.topics.it/wpf/radical/*`, can still be used but should be considered as obsolete and will be removed in V3.

### Breaking changes

#### XML namespaces

- XML namespace definition `http://schemas.topics.it/wpf/radical/windows/presentation/regions` changed to `http://schemas.topics.it/wpf/radical/windows/regions`.
- XML namespace definition `http://schemas.topics.it/wpf/radical/windows/presentation/behaviors` changed to `http://schemas.topics.it/wpf/radical/windows/behaviors`.

#### Removed and changed types and namespaces

- The type `Fact` has been removed. [`AutoCommandBinding`](https://docs.radicalframework.com/markup-extensions/auto-command-binding) supports boolean properties and regular property changed notifications.
- The `RadicalWpfApplication` type has been removed. If a `DoEvents`-like implementation is really needed original code can be copy/pasted from [GitHub commits history](https://github.com/RadicalFx/Radical.Windows/blob/fa52500164e26f351055034ffbcb87a085b64e4b/src/Radical.Windows/RadicalWpfApplication.cs#L6-L42).
- `EntityValidationService<T>` has been removed in favor of `DataAnnotationValidationService<T>`.
- `ApplicationBootstrapper` has been obsoleted in favor of the new `AddRadicalApplication<TMainView>()` extension method.
  - All virtual members are now sealed.
  - It will be removed in v3.
- `GetValidationService()` has been removed from `AbstractViewModel` and `AbstractMementoViewModel`. Use the new protected `ValidationService` property to set the current validation service instance.
- `Radical.Windows.Presentation` namespace has been merged into `Radical.Windows`.
- the `Topics` namespace prefix has been dropped, the new root namesapce is `Radical`.
- `WpfDispatcher` type has been made internal.

#### Behavior changes

- External IoC containers are not supported. Support for non default IoC containers will be available in a future minor release
- Services override is not supported anymore. In 1.x it was possible to override an existing radical default service by registering a custom one in the IoC container of choice. The feature wil be reintroduced in a future minor release along with support for external IoC containers

### How to migrate a Radical .NET Framework project to a Radical for .NET Core 3 one

1. Create a new .NET Core WPF project with the same name of the project you want to migrate
2. Replace the .NET Framework csproj file with the file of the project created on step 1 (the core project will scan and add all the files of the project, so no manual changes are needed)
3. Delete "Properties" folder 
4. Copy "AssemblyInfo.cs" from the project created on step 1 to the root project folder
5. Take note of the NuGet references from the "packages.config" file and then delete it. 
6. Add the needed references from NuGet
