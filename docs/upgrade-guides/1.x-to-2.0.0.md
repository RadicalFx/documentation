## Upgrade from Radical Presentation 1.x to Radical 2.0.0 for .NET Core

### Main facts

Starting with V2 radical Framework supports only .NET Core 3, the `Radical` package targets `netstandard2.0` and the `Radical.Windows` package targets `netcoreapp3.0`. WPF .NET Framework (what is generally referred as full framework) projects are not supported.

The `Radical.Windows.Presentation` package has been merged into `Radical.Windows` and by default the default IoC container provided by `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` will be used. V2.0.0 supports [external DI/IoC containers via generic host support](/ioc/third-party.md).

### New XML namespaces

New XML namespaces have been defined, the following is the list of the new namespaces:

- `http://schemas.radicalframework.com/windows/behaviors`
- `http://schemas.radicalframework.com/windows/input`
- `http://schemas.radicalframework.com/windows`
- `http://schemas.radicalframework.com/windows/converters`
- `http://schemas.radicalframework.com/windows/controls`
- `http://schemas.radicalframework.com/windows/effects`
- `http://schemas.radicalframework.com/windows/markup`
- `http://schemas.radicalframework.com/windows/regions` 

The existing XML namespaces, starting with `http://schemas.topics.it/wpf/radical/*`, can still be used but should be considered as obsolete and will be removed in V3.

### Breaking changes

#### Message broker `IMessage` support

The `IMessage` interface has been removed, message broker supports only POCO messages in V2.

#### `IEntityView` custom properties

Entity view `AddPropertyMapping` has been renamed to `AddCustomProperty`, `RemovePropertyMapping` to `RemoveCustomProperty`, and `IsPropertyMappingDefined` to `IsCustomPropertyDefined`

#### XML namespaces

- XML namespace definition `http://schemas.topics.it/wpf/radical/windows/presentation/regions` changed to `http://schemas.topics.it/wpf/radical/windows/regions`.
- XML namespace definition `http://schemas.topics.it/wpf/radical/windows/presentation/behaviors` changed to `http://schemas.topics.it/wpf/radical/windows/behaviors`.

#### Removed and changed types and namespaces

- The type `Fact` has been removed. [`AutoCommandBinding`](/markup-extensions/auto-command-binding) supports boolean properties and regular property changed notifications.
- The `RadicalWpfApplication` type has been removed. If a `DoEvents`-like implementation is really needed original code can be copy/pasted from [GitHub commits history](https://github.com/RadicalFx/Radical.Windows/blob/fa52500164e26f351055034ffbcb87a085b64e4b/src/Radical.Windows/RadicalWpfApplication.cs#L6-L42).
- `EntityValidationService<T>` has been removed in favor of `DataAnnotationValidationService<T>`.
- `ApplicationBootstrapper` has been obsoleted in favor of the new `AddRadicalApplication<TMainView>()` extension method.
  - All virtual members are now sealed.
  - It will be removed in v3.
- In case the solution uses `On` bostrapper events, nome them to `RadicalApplication( config => { ... })` (for example: [`Singleton Application`](/singleton-application))
- `GetValidationService()` has been removed from `AbstractViewModel` and `AbstractMementoViewModel`. Use the new protected `ValidationService` property to set the current validation service instance.
- `Radical.Windows.Presentation` namespace has been merged into `Radical.Windows`.
- the `Topics` namespace prefix has been dropped, the new root namesapce is `Radical`.
- `WpfDispatcher` type has been made internal.
- The AutoComplete behavior has been removed. To replace it, a sample demonstrating how to integrate with a third-party library is available in the [autocomplete sample folder](https://github.com/RadicalFx/documentation/tree/master/samples/AutocompleteSample).

#### Behavior changes

- [External IoC containers](/ioc/third-party.md) are supported via generic host support.
- Custom IoC registrations require the creation of a [dependency installer](/ioc).
- Services override is not supported anymore. In 1.x it was possible to override an existing radical default service by registering a custom one in the IoC container of choice. The feature wil be reintroduced in a future minor release along with support for external IoC containers

### How to migrate a Radical .NET Framework project to Radical for .NET Core 3

1. Create a new .NET Core 3 WPF project with the same name of the project you want to migrate
1. Replace the .NET Framework `csproj` file with the file of the project created at step 1 (the .NET Core project automatically adds all the files found in the current folder of the project, no manual changes are needed)
1. Create `appsettings.json` and copy the needed settings from `app.config`
1. Delete `app.config`
1. If `AssemblyInfo.cs` contains information that need to be migrated:
	- Rename `AssemblyInfo.cs` to `AssemblyInfo.old.cs`
	- Copy `AssemblyInfo.old.cs` to the root of the project
1. Delete the `Properties` folder 
1. Copy `AssemblyInfo.cs` from the project created on step 1 to the root project folder
	- If needed copy information from `AssemblyInfo.old.cs` to `AssemblyInfo.cs` and delete `AssemblyInfo.old.cs`
1. Add all the NuGet references a `PackageReference` to the new project:
	- Take note of the NuGet references from the `packages.config` file 
	- Add the needed references from NuGet
	- Delete `packages.config` file
1. "Find and Replace":
	- `using Topics.Radical` -> `using Radical`
	- `using Radical.Windows.Presentation.ComponentModel` -> `using Radical.Windows.ComponentModel`
	- `using Radical.Windows.Presentation.Messaging` -> `using Radical.Windows.Messaging`  
	- `http://schemas.topics.it/wpf/radical/` -> `http://schemas.radicalframework.com/`
	- `http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/2010/interactivity` -> `http://schemas.microsoft.com/xaml/behaviors`
	- `Broadcast(new CloseViewRequest(this))` -> `Broadcast(this, new CloseViewRequest(this))`
1. "Find and Remove"
	- `http://schemas.radicalframework.com/windows/presentation/behaviors` (behaviors are now in `http://schemas.radicalframework.com/windows/behaviors`)
	- `using Radical.Windows.Presentation.Boot;`
1. Look at all the obsolete warnings and adjust code as necessary
