# Upgrade from Radical 2.0.0 to 2.1.0

In version `2.1.0` the `IRequireValidationCallback<TViewModel>` has been obsoleted. It'll be removed in version 3.0.0. The `IRequireValidationCallback<>` behavior can be replaced by using a [custom validation rule](../mvvm/validation-validationservice.md#custom-rules), like in the following snippet:

```csharp
class SampleViewModel : AbstractViewModel, IRequireValidation
{
    public SampleViewModel()
    {
        ValidationService = new DataAnnotationValidationService<SampleViewModel>( this )
            .AddRule
            (
                property: () => this.Text,
                rule: ctx => ctx.Failed("This is the error message.")
            );
    }
}
```
