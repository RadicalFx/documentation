- This project uses [GitHub flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) for pull requests. So if you want to contribute, fork the repo, create a descriptively named branch off of master (ie: portable-class-library-support), fix an issue, run all the unit tests, and send a PR if all is green.
- Please rebase your code on top of the latest commits. Before working on your fork make sure you pull the latest so you work on top of the latests commits to avoid merge conflicts. Also before sending the PR please rebase your code as there is a chance there have been new commits pushed after you pulled last.
- We will only merge PR that could be automatically merged.
