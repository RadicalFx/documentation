### Friction less: Conventions based

Our first aim is to remove friction, it is not always easy and cannot be done every single time, but one thing that can give a lot of benefits in this area is to move from a configuration based toolkit to a convention based toolkit, we suppose that this concept is widely accepted and is nothing new.

What happens when these lines of code are executed:

```csharp
public partial class App : Application
{
    public App()
    {
        var bootstrapper = new WindsorApplicationBootstrapper<MainView>();
    }
}
```

A lot of things:

1. The application Startup event is wired;
2. When the Startup event is fired:
   1. The Inversion of Control container is created;
   2. The MEF composition container is created;
   3. The composition container is composed against the bootstrapper itself;
   4. The Inversion of Control container is configured using the [bootstrap conventions](//mvvm/bootstrap-conventions.md);
   5. The main window \(the one identified by the TShellView generic parameter\) is resolved and shown;
